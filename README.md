If you thought that minecraft wasn't hard enough. This mod aims to add more variety to the difficulties in Minecraft. Now making it harder to eat, see and regenerate health.

Ever felt like sleeping in Minecraft should be more beneficial, then fear not! Making it mandatory to have a bed early on, this mod features effects and buffs upon waking up that you do not want to miss out on.

But don't be a sleepy sloth! Licking the warm, dripping blood or ehm, bone?, from your sword will give you quiet the kick.

Enough of the talking now. Let's get into it.

## Easy
- health will regenerate by eating food (regenerates the same amount as the food points)
- sleeping will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Instant Health      | II    | -        |
    | Strength            | I     | 180s     |
    | Hunger              | I     | 10s      |

- killing a hostile mob will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Strength            | I     | 10s      |
    | Mining Fatigue      | I     | 3s       |

## Normal
- health will regenerate by eating food (regenerates half of the food points; flooring the number)
- sleeping will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Instant Health      | II    | -        |
    | Strength            | I     | 180s     |
    | Hunger              | I     | 20s      |
    | Blindness           | I     | 10s      |

- killing a hostile mob will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Strength            | I     | 8s       |
    | Mining Fatigue      | I     | 3s       |

- sprinting may cause fatigue (don't sprint to long or you might become exhausted; one random effect from the list below):

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Slowness            | I     | 5s       |
    | Hunger              | I     | 5s       |

## Hard
- health will not regenerate; potion effects, sleep and golden apples may help
- sleeping will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Instant Health      | I     | -        |
    | Strength            | I     | 180s     |
    | Hunger              | I     | 30s      |
    | Blindness           | I     | 15s      |
    | Slowness            | I     | 15s      |
