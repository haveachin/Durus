If you thought that minecraft wasn't hard enough. This mod aims to add more variety to the difficulties in Minecraft.

Ever felt like sleeping in Minecraft should be more beneficial, then brace yourself! Making it mandatory to have a bed early on, this mod features effects and buffs upon waking up that you do not want to miss out on.

But don't be a sleepy sloth! Licking the warm, dripping blood or ehm, bone?, from your sword will give you quiet the thrill.

Enough of the talking now. Let's get onto it.

## Easy
- health will regenerate by eating food (regenerates the same amount as the food points)
- sleeping will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Instant Health      | II    | -        |
    | Strength            | I     | 12min    |
    | Hunger              | I     | 10s      |

- killing a hostile mob will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration | Chance |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: | -----: |
    | Strength            | I     | 10s      | 100%   |
    | Mining Fatigue      | I     | 3s       | 25%    |

## Normal
- health will regenerate by eating food (regenerates half of the food points; flooring the number)
- sleeping will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Instant Health      | II    | -        |
    | Strength            | I     | 10min    |
    | Hunger              | I     | 20s      |
    | Blindness           | I     | 10s      |

- killing a hostile mob will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration | Chance |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: | -----: |
    | Strength            | I     | 8s       | 100%   |
    | Mining Fatigue      | I     | 3s       | 25%    |

- sprinting may cause fatigue (don't sprint to long or you might become exhausted; after running for 20 seconds there is a 10% chance to get a debuff every second):

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Slowness            | I     | 5s       |
    | Hunger              | I     | 5s       |

## Hard
- health will not regenerate; potion effects, sleep and golden apples may help
- sleeping will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Instant Health      | I     | -        |
    | Strength            | I     | 8min     |
    | Hunger              | I     | 30s      |
    | Blindness           | I     | 15s      |
    | Slowness            | I     | 15s      |

- killing a hostile mob will grant:

    | Effect              | Level | Duration | Chance |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: | -----: |
    | Strength            | II    | 5s       | 100%   |
    | Mining Fatigue      | I     | 3s       | 25%    |

- sprinting may cause fatigue (don't sprint to long or you might become exhausted; after running for 20 seconds there is a 10% chance to get a debuff every second):

    | Effect              | Level | Duration |
    | ------------------- | :---: | -------: |
    | Slowness            | II    | 5s       |
    | Hunger              | II    | 5s       |
